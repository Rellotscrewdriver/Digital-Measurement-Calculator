## DIC(Digital Measurement Calculator)

DIC is a measurement calculator which calculates the shapes of all measurements, 
it also dectects whether you type a text instead of an integer.
you'll be ask to input the shape dimension, shape to choose,
which type of measurement, it's parameters and Bam! you get the correct answer.
you can also switch to 3D shapes when on 2D shapes list or vice-versa
it can also dump a log file to see your result in a file(planned but not implemented yet)
Idk Who will use this project, measurement guys? *shurgs*
the goal of this project to offer a lot of customizability, small file size(under 2MB) and great speed :)
